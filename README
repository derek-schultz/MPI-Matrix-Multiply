Hello Justin,

Unfortunately, I ran into some problems when trying to run my code on the BG/Q.
My last attempt took a very long time in the queue (I wasn't sure if it was
going to finish in time) and when I got home today (Monday) I found that it had
failed due to a syntax error in my batch script. I immediately resubmitted, but
at the rate jobs are going through, it doesn't appear as though it will finish
in the next few hours.

Everything is present here, except for the analysis and results from the BG/Q.
I am simply waiting at this point, as the Q appears to be very busy. I hope
that you will accept my results via email as soon as I receive data from the Q,
but I will understand if you cannot.

Thank you,
Derek Schultz

Available targets:
==================

make kratos: Compiles and runs a 8192 square matrix on 8 cores

make quick: Compiles and runs a 1024 square matrix on 8 cores

make verify: Same as make quick, but prints out mpi rank 1's part of the matrix

make bgq: For the Blue Gene Q. Builds, but does not run. Changes CLOCK_RATE.

make clean: Deletes everything in ./bin


Executing the program yourself:
===============================

If you need to, here is the usage:

bin/matrix_multiply <matrix_size> [--print_matrix]

--print_matrix is an optional flag that indicates the mpi rank 1's portion of
the matrix should printed


Running on the BG/Q:
====================

Batch script is in ./bgq
